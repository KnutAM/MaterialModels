# MaterialModels
This repository contains user material models for Abaqus (UMAT) written by Knut Andreas Meyer. It is organized in folders based on the papers in which each different model is first used. If you publish any results based on any of these models, please cite the relevant paper. 

### References to papers in which the codes are first used
